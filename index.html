          <p class="text-justify">"Bootstrap" is what's known as an open source toolkit used for developing alongside HTML, CSS, and JS. It makes creating projects with these languages super easy and incredibly intuitive. You're able to quickly prototype your ideas or even build your entire app with Bootstrap's Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and their powerful plugins built on jQuery. All of these make for Bootstrap to become one of the most powerful tools to use when creating websites.</p>
